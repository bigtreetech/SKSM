# Mounts
This is a DIN rail mount for the SKSM. 

STEP and STL files are provided so that you can edit them to suit your needs. The standard files have been designed to work with Voron size M3 threaded inserts. For other size threaded inserts you may need to modify the files.

To assemble, simply insert all threaded inserts, screw the base to the top and then screw the SKSM to the top. You will need 6 threaded inserts.
